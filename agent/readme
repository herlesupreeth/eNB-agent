	EmPOWER Agent core

This is the standalone logic for the agent. It completely abstracts over the
technology used and provides a communication interface for the controller.



  BUILD
  
This software can be compiled in several way, depending on the necessity. It can
be directly included in your project (by adding the source files to your make), 
as a static library, which can be later added to your project, or as a dynamic
library (the project standard make action).

Usually you can desire to have it included in your project (direct inclusion or
static library) when you want to build a standalone-like application, which does
not need installation.

In any case, for this two case you need to have your own make, since the default
one just support dynamic library compilation. I already tried those approach and
they generate no problems with the agent core elements.

  
  
  DEBUGGING

In order to debug the core you can compile the library using the command
"make debug". This will includes debugging messages to the core procedures, but
will make everything really verbose.
