	EmPOWER Agent protocols
	


The agent protocols are built around 3 major classification of the events that
can occurs in the system, which are:
  
  - Single: This are synchronous events, requested by the controller and 
    notified back immediately by the agents. This match the behavior of a 
    request&reply message.
    
  - Scheduled: This are asynchronous events scheduled to be fired in the agents.
    This allows to schedule in the future a certain event, or give to it a 
    certain interval after that is always invoked(until the controller decide to
    remove it).
    
  - Triggered: This are a mix of the previous two, since the trigger can be 
    invoked at uncertain times. When a condition in the system happens, the 
    agent must react and communicate such event to the controller. 
    These are part of an on/off mechanism: when the trigger is activated you 
    are nontified of it, and then you can activate the necessary mechanism to 
    react to the event (base-station implementation specific). If such event 
    happens but you don't find the trigger in the agent, this means that it has
    been remove and you can disable the trigger notification.
    
All the messages can be one of this three main family, but usually some messages
does not fix a particular family: for example the Hello message is just of type 
"single", since it does not makes sense to have it Triggered or Scheduled.
The agent will automatically schedule an hello every time it connects to the 
controller, and will transmit a message as if the controller requested an Hello
to the base station.
