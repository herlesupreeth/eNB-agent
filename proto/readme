	EMpower communication PROTOcol library



These are the Google protocol buffer source files of the communication which
takes places between the Agent and the Controller.



  BUILD

Same rules that are valid for the agent applies here: the project is compiled by
default as a shared library, that must be installed in your system. If you 
desire to build a standalone application, just include the straight source files
in your project, switch to static library compilation.
